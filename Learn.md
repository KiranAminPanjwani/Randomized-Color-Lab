# Learning Through This Project:

Random-Color-Lab Project is easy to play and understand color guessing game. I created this website while learning front-end development. In this project, I used all the basic React JS principles (components, properties, and hooks), and color hex codes are stored using the UseState() - Hook concept. I believe this project will help the learners to understand the basic concepts of React and how to implement them.

üëâThrough this readme, you will learn about one of the hooks provided by React, called _**useState**_. Also sometimes called "_**State Hook**_". This lets us add native state to React function components.

**<h3>What is a Hook?</h3>** A Hook is a special function that lets you ‚Äúhook into‚Äù React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.

**<h3>When would I use a Hook?</h3>** If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can use a Hook inside the existing function component.

**<h3>What does useState() in React do?</h3>** **useState()** is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components . To use the <ins>useState</ins> Hook, we first need to <ins>import</ins> it at the top of our component.
_Like this:_

_Now, let's take an example of useState():_

**<h3>What does calling useState() do in our Project?</h3>** It declares a ‚Äústate variable‚Äù. Here, our variable is _**isWin**_ but we could call it anything else, like _**dolphin**_. This is a way to ‚Äúpreserve‚Äù some values between the function calls ‚Äî **useState** is a new way to use the exact same capabilities that **this.state** provides in a class. Normally, variables ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù when the function exits but state variables are preserved by React.

_Some other examples:_

- _**Line 6:**_ Represents an array useState to hold 6 different color hexcodes.
- _**Line 7:**_ Represents a numerical useState and here its initial value is set to zero.
- _**Line 8:**_ Represents a boolean useState and its initial value can be set to null/true/false.

**<h3>What does useState return?</h3>** It returns a pair of values: the current state and a function that updates it. This is why we write _const [num, setnum] = useState()_.

_For example:_

- _**Line 1:**_ We import the **useState** Hook from React. It lets us keep local state in a function component.
- _**Line 4:**_ Inside the _**Example**_ component, we declare a new state variable by calling the _**useState**_ Hook. It returns a pair of values, to which we give names. We‚Äôre calling our variable num because it holds the number of button clicks. We initialize it to zero by passing _**0**_ as the only _useState_ argument. The second returned item is itself a function. It lets us update the num so we‚Äôll name it _**setnum**_.
- _**Line 9:**_ When the user clicks, we call setnum with a new value. React will then re-render the _**Example**_ component, passing the new _**num**_ value to it.

**<h3>What does useEffect() in React do?</h3>** **useEffect()** React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you pass inside the useEffect() and call it later after performing the DOM updates. To use the <ins>useState</ins> Hook, we first need to <ins>import</ins> it at the top of our component.
_Like this:_

_Now, let's take an example of useState():_

![syntax of useEffect()](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76689021/193349652-d19e03bf-4090-4106-9b9a-2923c894cb68.png)

**<h3>What does calling useState() do in our Project?</h3>** It performs a function whenever the page / component is rendered. This function is referred to as in React as an "effect". Here, we **useEffect** is being used to set states - **isWin** and **hexcode** for the initial render of the component.

![code_snippet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76689021/193349736-e67e285a-22cd-46b6-8c60-b8a14ef5d640.png)

- _**Line 15:**_ Sets the **isWin** state to empty string.
- _**Line 16:**_ Sets the hexcode array to an empty array.
- _**Line 17:**_ Performs a loop 6 times in order to set all the values in the hexcode array to grey color.

_The component for the initial render looks like this:_
